positive = "Clean, comfortable and great spot on the waterfront. Short walk to the centre and train station to get around the rest of the coast. Staff friendly, restaurant food selection good for breakfast and dinner. Bar nice to sit outside during the summer days and evenings."
negative = "Wow, what a bad experience. Total lack of any customer care values; I never thought I would be treated without any respect in a 4**** hotel of Marriott brand. Long story short I was not let in to the breakfast area by the “check-in person” because of some misunderstand (he claimed that I have not an “opened account” even though 400 euros were blocked on my Credit Card during the check-in). Sure, errors happen but the issue was a lack of any willingness from the employee to fix. He did not care repeating all the time “you pay or not?!”. The way he was talking to me was shocking as his behaviour was slightly worse than boorish. I have no idea how someone like this could get any job in a customer facing environment (especially in hospitality). Dreadful experience. Will not stay there again. On another note: I asked for a feather less bedding I was assured it was provided and…. got feather pillows."
